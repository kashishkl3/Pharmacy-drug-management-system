# Pharmacy-drug-management-system
A team mini-project developed during summer semester. A lot of design and details were taken from internet.This project is a web application which is developed in Java, JSP, Servlet and
MySQL. It works on the Sales Reporting and Management System-Pharma 
project to enhance the growth of pharma employees or the companies.
This project is used to develop an online web portal that can handle product 
information of customers as well as vendors. This type of application will 
atomize the procedure of drug supply through the Pharmaceuticals Company 
and improve business standards and customer relationships. Using this
application, the distributors can view detailed information of transactions and 
get drugs information and see future orders from his account. Customers can 
easily visit this site and register themself, by filling a registration form. Once a 
customer is registered, he/she can login using their email and password and can 
buy products easily that are available in the application. The application is also 
used by the vendors to restock the medicines that are demanded by the 
customers.
